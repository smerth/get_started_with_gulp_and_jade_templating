# Todo

- [ ] `gulpfile.js` implements an environment variable for development and production. Use the variable in each task to build either a production build (clean, compressed, etc...) or a development build (uncompressed, with maps, etc.)
- [ ] write tasks for processing js - first decide what would be useful, ES6?...
- [x] upgrade from jade to pug (gulp-pug)
- [ ] after upgrading to pug the links are broken. they work on home page but not on gulp page. Has to do with the relative paths to layout.
- [ ] upgrade to Bootstrap 4
